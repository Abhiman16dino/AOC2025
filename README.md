## Advent of Code 2025

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 solutions repository. This collection contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 programming puzzles, organized by day. Each day typically includes two parts (Part One and Part Two). The repository is designed to be easy to navigate, run, and extend.

### Repository structure

- `Day_X/` - Folder for each day (e.g., `Day_1/`) containing input and solution files
	- `input.txt` - the puzzle input for that day
	- `one.js` - solution for Part One (JavaScript)
	- `two.js` - solution for Part Two (JavaScript)
- `util.js` - shared utilities used by solutions (input helpers, parsing)
- `README.md` - this file

### Getting started

Requirements

- Node.js v14+ (or compatible)

Run a solution

1. Open a terminal in the repository root.
2. Run the script for a specific day/part. For example, to run Day 1 Part One:

```bash
# from repository root
node Day_1/one.js
```

Replace `one.js` with `two.js` to run Part Two for that day.

If a `getData` helper is used (from `util.js`), ensure local `input.txt` exists in the day folder.


### Notes and conventions

- Solutions are organized by day in `Day_X` folders.
- Files are written in JavaScript and are intended to be run with Node.js.
- Inputs should be named `input.txt` and placed in the corresponding day folder.

### Results matrix

Input can be found on respective day folder.

The table below summarizes the completion status for each day and its two parts. Columns represent days (1–12). Rows are: `Day`, `Part One`, and `Part Two`. The table is intentionally left empty for you to fill in status/results.

|            | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4 | Day 5 | Day 6 | Day 7 | Day 8 | Day 9 | Day 10 | Day 11 | Day 12 |
|------------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
